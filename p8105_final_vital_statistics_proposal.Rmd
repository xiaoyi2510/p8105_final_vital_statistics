####The tentative project title
Vital Statistics in New York - Saving Lives by Counting Deaths

<br>

####The motivation for this project
Understanding the pattern of birth and death is of critical importance in identifying public health issue. In particular, maternal and infant mortality serve as key indicators of the overall health of society. In this study, we are interested in exploring the birth defects in the infants and cause of deaths in New York City. We will further investigate whether there are disparities among different age, ethnicity and sex groups. 

<br>

####The intended final products
We will determine the top ten causes of death in New York and make stratified analysis to go in depth into the factors which were hidden in the data. Specifically, we will identify the leading causes of death by sex, race, age, place of origin/birth and borough of residence and explore whether there is a socioeconomic disparity in terms of premature death and infant mortality/defect ï¼ˆwhether statistics differs between low-income area and high-income area). We could also examine changes in the makeup of leading causes of death during the last decade. We are also intended to take a look at the birth defect data to investigate the main causes of birth defect, the ratio of birth defect leading to infant mortality and we will also explore relationships between maternal factors and infant factors in the birth defect cases.

<br>

####The anticipated data sources
Data is from the nyc department of health. 

Two datasets will mainly be used, which are the birth micro SAS Datasets [Year(s)] and death micro SAS Datasets [Year(s)] from National Vital Statistics System. Time period is from 2000 to 2014.

<br>

####The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
We will use R to make our data analysis. We will analyze the time trend with vital statistics data in each neighbourhood and also  analyse on the disease specific data (ie. pancreatic cancer) to explore the factors that are associated with deaths or birth deficits.

Visualizations will be mainly delivered by ggplot, which contains spaghetti plot, histogram, scatterplot, boxplot and so on.

Coding Challenges might be the statistical tests using R.
